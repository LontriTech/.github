# Fr Platform

Tools and Code for building an internal platform fast and as free as it gets.

# How it works

**Everything** here is meant to assist in the building of internal platforms no matter the company and the tools it uses.

**Everyone** should be able to reference/fork/copy the contents of any repository or consume/copy any package, there's also no limit to redistribution, modification or closed source versions of the contents, it's actually **encouraged**!

# Technologies

What's currently on our menu in terms of content and tooling.

## Terraform

We have templates and should have modules and more very soon.
